The lecture notes intend to give the students a basic knowledge regarding data wrangling and plotting: Installing packages Opening data Plotting simple graphs and plotting nicer graphs Combining data files Generating variables Also, in these notes, we cover the most appropriate empirical methods to make causal inferences for students to understand in a basic sense how we can perform the analysis with R: Running (and interpreting) a simple regression Running IV regressions Running simple diff-in-diffs Generating summary statistics tables Running t-tests Producing .tex tables Running RDD Using different kinds of standard errors "],["setting-r.html", "1 Setting R", " 1 Setting R R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, which can be extended through packages. R was built as an open-source project, meaning every package and software is free! You can visit their site if you are interested in more technical aspects. To start using R, you need to install two complementary things: R: is the raw software that will run the code R Studio: is an Integrated Development Software (IDE), a computer application that provides comprehensive services to make it easier for the developer or programmer to develop software. Both installations are designed to be simple and accessible: R, The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), can be downloaded for any platform. After clicking the link, choose the appropriate (Linux, (Mac) OS X, or Windows) installation file for R. Download and install R on your computer. R studio provides the previous step and its installation in the following link. A nice overview of R Studio interface and windows can be found at RStudio Layout. The reference works through an R Studio server; since our recommendation and approach is to download R studio, you don’t have to worry about logging in.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter ??. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 4.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 4.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 4.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 8.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
