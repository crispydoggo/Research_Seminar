Welcome! 

These are the online lecture notes for empirical methods using `R` from Jaakko's Research Seminar at  ITAM.

The lecture notes intend to give the students a basic knowledge regarding data wrangling and plotting: 

- Installing packages
- Opening data
- Plotting simple graphs and plotting nicer graphs
- Combining data files
- Generating variables

Also,  in these notes, we cover the most appropriate empirical methods to make causal inferences for students to understand in a basic sense how we can perform the analysis with R: 
 
- Running (and interpreting) a simple regression
- Running IV regressions
- Running simple diff-in-diffs
- Generating summary statistics tables
- Running t-tests
- Producing .tex tables
- Running RDD
- Using different kinds of standard errors
