# Welcome {-}

These are the online lecture notes for empirical methods using `R` from **Jaakko Meriläinen's Research Seminar** at  ITAM.

The lecture notes intend to give the students a **basic knowledge** regarding data wrangling and plotting: 

- Installing packages
- Opening data
- Plotting simple graphs and plotting nicer graphs
- Combining data files
- Generating variables

Also,  in these notes, we cover the most appropriate **empirical methods** to make causal inferences for students to understand in a basic sense how we can perform the analysis with `R`: 
 
- Running (and interpreting) a simple regression
- Running IV regressions
- Running simple diff-in-diffs
- Generating summary statistics tables
- Running t-tests
- Producing .tex tables
- Running RDD
- Using different kinds of standard errors
